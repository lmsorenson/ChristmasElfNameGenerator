# Christmas Elf Name Generator

This repository contains a minimal Blazor Server app scaffold under `src/ChristmasElfNameGenerator.Server`.

Run the app locally:

```bash
cd src/ChristmasElfNameGenerator.Server
dotnet run
```

By default the app will report the URL(s) to browse (for example `https://localhost:5001`).

What I added:

- A Blazor Server project at `src/ChristmasElfNameGenerator.Server` (`.csproj`, `Program.cs`).
- A simple UI (`Pages/Index.razor`) that generates a random elf name.
- Shared layout and basic CSS under `Shared/` and `wwwroot/css/app.css`.

Next steps I can do for you (ask to pick any):

- Add a unit/integration test project.
- Create a solution file and VS Code launch tasks.
- Scaffold a Blazor WebAssembly client instead.

Happy to continue — tell me which of the above you'd like next.
